1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?
Answer: Fashion MNIST is a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items such as shirts, shoes, and bags.
        Each image is 28×28 pixels and belongs to one of 10 classes, commonly used for training and testing image classification models.

2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?



3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.



4. What does an epoch mean in model training?



5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.


6. What could be done to improve the model’s accuracy?
